In this webiste, I introduce our team's video 'Connect, To Connect' along with other films that were produced by students in our Communications Lab course. This term, the topic was "Connection and Interaction." 30 Minutes Film Festival is a film festival held by the Interactive Media team of New York University Abu Dhabi. 30MFF is credited for proving strenghts of short films. While participants were only given 30 minutes to film and edit, expectations and results of the festival is high. This year, 4 impactful and inspiring videos were presented.In the main page, the topic is introduced and the films are shown. There are links to the official NYUAD website and the Interactive Media Team of NYUAD.

The colours were chosen to show a serious but a positive atmosphere. Personally, I was impressed by the messages that were created and delivered in such a short time. The blue-ish colour and light white colours deliver such mood.

Our team's video was "Connect, To Connect.'
"Connect, To Connect" talks about how our current world connects. As Covid-19 rises, face-to-face interactions have become harder than before. When our devices are connected to the sockets, our connections start. We connect at different locations of the world with different languages, but we all connect the same way. The video emphasises how the connections all start from a socket and a charger by rewinding backwards.

When you click 'meet the teams,' it moves on to another page where you can meet the names and the general profile of the participants. There is a lack of profile photos and was replaced with an annonymous profile photo. I also wanted add where each of us are from and what we are studying or majoring. However, the survey I sent out didn't get enough responses, so I replaced them with simple information like netIDs I can get. 

When you click the topic, 'Connection and Interaction,' you get an alert (done by js) that you will jump to the lower part of the website. When it it clicked, it will jump to the point where the first video starts. It was possible to jump to another page, but I thought there weren't enough contents to split into two pages. So, I decided to use the link to jump to the place where I wanted.

I hope this website delivers the mood I hoped to deliver.
